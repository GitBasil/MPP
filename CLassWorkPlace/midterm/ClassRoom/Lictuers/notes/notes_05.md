# Class room notes 01

class can implements multiple interfaces, but only one extends (inheritance)
all methods in interface are public abstract

UML to show that the relation is iinterface make the line broken

## note
when you inhertance or interface you can increase the access but you cannot decrease, ex. if it's protected in the super you can make it public in the subclass
