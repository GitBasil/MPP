# Class room notes 01

## 2 types of languages:
1. Procedural analysis & design
2. OO analysis & design

## Objects have
1. State : is the content of this object
2. Behavior : is the functions of the object
3. Idendity : Referreals of the object

## Encapsulation and data hiding
1. data hiding is data attributes and functions and it's data access ex. private, public, ...
2. encaopsulation is the class that is capsoling all the data and functions

## SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle
1. User requirments (Analysis)
2. Create a static Model (Analysis)
    properties vs attributes
        properties are both variables and objects
        attributes are variables
3. Add relationsships to the static model (Analysis)
4. Create dynamic model (Analysis)
5. Enhance the static dynamic model (Design)


## UML - Unified Modeling Language
it's used to build a map of objects-interactin-with-objects

## Diagrams
1. Use Case Diagram
2. Class Diagram
3. Sequence Diagram
4. Object Diagram

## Use cases 
- Main flow is the success flow of a use case
- alternative flows are the fail flows

## Key abstrations:
    are the names of classes that we got from analysing the requirments
