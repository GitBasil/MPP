# Class room notes 03

## data access
1. public
2. private
3. protected
4. default

## inheritance
1. abstract class is a class that you dont genertate an object directly from it its just just to be inherited.
2. abstract you must implement all the methods in it in the childs

when you should inherate:
1. IS-A so if you can say manager is a employee then most likely you can have inhertance
2. when the super class method will never break if you use it from the child then you can inherte

##to stop inhertance
1. make the class final
2. make the constructor private and make a static method that return an object
