# Lesson 7

## notes
- slide 7 will have a question in the final
- review the type of classes from the 01 pdf

## Diamond error
1. if the 2 interfaces has the same method implemented as default the compiler will force you to implement your own code in the method
2. if the interface  has a method and the class you are inheriting from has the same the comlier will always choose the super method not the interface
3. if the methods are static, there is no problem because you are calling the static method by calling the name of the class.

## general notes
1. template pattern means that the interface is calling methods that will be implemented in the subclassess
