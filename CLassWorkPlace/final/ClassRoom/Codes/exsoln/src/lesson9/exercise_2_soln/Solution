The code is creating a list of int arrays having
lengths determined successively by the elements
of ints. Note that by default, the values in these
int arrays are always 0. It then converts this list of int[]s
into a list of strings by applying toString
to each array. The output is the following:

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
